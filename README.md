# image
By applying haar wavelet using a step function as the mother wavelet(exciting function) to an image in the ppm/pgm format I am able to get the constitute frequency and used to compress the image 

Before using the following you'll need to have installed the following
1. Netpbm for image conversion

For a jpeg file you need to run the following on you Linux terminal ```C jpegtopnm <name of your jpeg file> > destination``` to convert the jpeg to ppm format
Then run the image-analysis using code::blocks
